# 第四章 - 組織程式碼和介面

該是時候來看看怎麼組織我們的程式碼了。

## 套件

為了學習更複雜的函式庫和組織系統，我們需要學習套件。在 Go 中，套件名稱和你的工作目錄結構有關。
如果我們想要建構一個購物車系統，也許我們會用 "shopping" 作為套件名稱，並且把我們的程式碼
放在 `$GOPATH/src/shopping/` 目錄下。

我們不想要把所有的東西都放在這個目錄。比如說，我們可能會想要把資料庫的邏輯放在專屬他的資料夾。
為了達到這樣的目的，我們可以建立一個子資料夾 `$GOPATH/src/shopping/db`。在這個資料夾中的套件名稱可以簡單的稱作 `db`，
但是如果其他的套件想要存取他時，就必須要把 `shopping` 套件名稱也寫

換句話說，當你需要針對套件命名時，只要使用 `package` 關鍵字，並且提供一個名稱即可，而不需要把整個階層都寫上去（例如：`shopping` 或 `db`）。
但是當你要引用套件時，就需要把完整的路徑寫上。

讓我們試試看，在你的工作目錄 `src` 下，建立一個新的資料夾叫做 `shopping`，接著在下面建立一個子資料夾 `db`：

在 `shopping/db` 中，建立一個 `db.go` 的檔案，並撰寫以下程式碼：

```go
package db

type Item struct {
  Price float64
}

func LoadItem(id int) *Item {
  return &Item{
    Price: 9.001,
  }
}
```

注意這個套件的名稱跟資料夾名稱一樣。很明顯的我們並沒有實際存取資料庫，這裡只是要學習如何組織我們的程式碼而已。

接著在 `shopping` 目錄中建立一個 `pricecheck.go` 的檔案，並寫入以下程式碼：

```go
package shopping

import (
  "shopping/db"
)

func PriceCheck(itemId int) (float64, bool) {
  item := db.LoadItem(itemId)
  if item == nil {
    return 0, false
  }
  return item.Price, true
}
```

你可以會認為我們已經在 `shopping` 目錄下了，還要引用 `shopping/db` 會有點奇怪。事實上，我們是引用 `$GOPATH/src/shopping/db`，
這意味著你可以很容易引用 `test/db` 這樣的套件，只要你有一個 `db` 的套件在你工作目錄下的 `src/test` 目錄中。

如果你想要建構一個套件，你只需要以上的步驟即可。如果想要建置可執行檔，你需要一個包含 `main` 的檔案。
我建議的方式是在 `shopping` 目錄中建立一個子目錄 `main`，並在裡面建立一個 `main.go` 的檔案：

```go
package main

import (
  "shopping"
  "fmt"
)

func main() {
  fmt.Println(shopping.PriceCheck(4343))
}
```

現在你可以執行你的 `shopping` 專案：

```
go run main/main.go
```

### Cyclical Imports

As you start writing more complex systems, you're bound to run into cyclical imports. This happens when package A imports package B but package B imports package A (either directly or indirectly through another package). This is something the compiler won't allow.

Let's change our shopping structure to cause the error.

Move the `Item` definition from `shopping/db/db.go` into `shopping/pricecheck.go`. Your `pricecheck.go` file should now look like:

```go
package shopping

import (
  "shopping/db"
)

type Item struct {
  Price float64
}

func PriceCheck(itemId int) (float64, bool) {
  item := db.LoadItem(itemId)
  if item == nil {
    return 0, false
  }
  return item.Price, true
}
```

If you try to run the code, you'll get a couple of errors from `db/db.go` about `Item` being undefined. This makes sense. `Item` no longer exists in the `db` package; it's been moved to the shopping package. We need to change `shopping/db/db.go` to:

```go
package db

import (
  "shopping"
)

func LoadItem(id int) *shopping.Item {
  return &shopping.Item{
    Price: 9.001,
  }
}
```

Now when you try to run the code, you'll get a dreaded *import cycle not allowed* error. We solve this by introducing another package which contains shared structures. Your directory structure should look like:

```
$GOPATH/src
  - shopping
    pricecheck.go
    - db
      db.go
    - models
      item.go
    - main
      main.go
```

`pricecheck.go` will still import `shopping/db`, but `db.go` will now import `shopping/models` instead of `shopping`, thus breaking the cycle. Since we moved the shared `Item` structure to `shopping/models/item.go`, we need to change `shopping/db/db.go` to reference the `Item` structure from `models` package:

```go
package db

import (
  "shopping/models"
)

func LoadItem(id int) *models.Item {
  return &models.Item{
    Price: 9.001,
  }
}
```

You'll often need to share more than just `models`, so you might have other similar folder named `utilities` and such. The important rule about these shared packages is that they shouldn't import anything from the `shopping` package or any sub-packages. In a few sections, we'll look at interfaces which can help us untangle these types of dependencies.

### Visibility

Go uses a simple rule to define what types and functions are visible outside of a package. If the name of the type or function starts with an uppercase letter, it's visible. If it starts with a lowercase letter, it isn't.

This also applies to structure fields. If a structure field name starts with a lowercase letter, only code within the same package will be able to access them.

For example, if our `items.go` file had a function that looked like:

```go
func NewItem() *Item {
  // ...
}
```

it could be called via `models.NewItem()`. But if the function was named `newItem`, we wouldn't be able to access it from a different package.

Go ahead and change the name of the various functions, types and fields from the `shopping` code. For example, if you rename the `Item's` `Price` field to `price`, you should get an error.

### Package Management

The `go` command we've been using to `run` and `build` has a `get` subcommand which is used to fetch third-party libraries. `go get` supports various protocols but for this example, we'll be getting a library from Github, meaning, you'll need `git` installed on your computer.

Assuming you already have git installed, from a shell/command prompt, enter:

```
go get github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3
```

`go get` fetches the remote files and stores them in your workspace. Go ahead and check your `$GOPATH/src`. In addition to the `shopping` project that we created, you'll now see a `github.com` folder. Within, you'll see a `mattn` folder which contains a `go-sqlite3` folder.

We just talked about how to import packages that live in our workspace. To use our newly gotten `go-sqlite3` package, we'd import it like so:

```go
import (
  "github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3"
)
```

I know this looks like a URL but in reality, it'll simply import the `go-sqlite3` package which it expects to find in `$GOPATH/src/github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3`.

### Dependency Management

`go get` has a couple of other tricks up its sleeve. If we `go get` within a project, it'll scan all the files, looking for `imports` to third-party libraries and will download them. In a way, our own source code becomes a `Gemfile` or `package.json`.

If you call `go get -u` it'll update the packages (or you can update a specific package via `go get -u FULL_PACKAGE_NAME`).

Eventually, you might find `go get` inadequate. For one thing, there's no way to specify a revision, it always points to the master/head/trunk/default. This is an even larger problem if you have two projects needing different versions of the same library.

To solve this, you can use a third-party dependency management tool. They are still young, but two promising ones are [goop](https://github.com/nitrous-io/goop) and [godep](https://github.com/tools/godep). A more complete list is available at the [go-wiki](https://code.google.com/p/go-wiki/wiki/PackageManagementTools).

## Interfaces

Interfaces are types that define a contract but not an implementation. Here's an example:

```go
type Logger interface {
  Log(message string)
}
```

You might be wondering what purpose this could possibly serve. Interfaces help decouple your code from specific implementations. For example, we might have various types of loggers:

```go
type SqlLogger struct { ... }
type ConsoleLogger struct { ... }
type FileLogger struct { ... }
```

Yet by programming against the interface, rather than these concrete implementations, we can easily change (and test) which we use without any impact to our code.

How would you use one? Just like any other type, it could be a structure's field:

```go
type Server struct {
  logger Logger
}
```

or a function parameter (or return value):

```go
func process(logger Logger) {
  logger.Log("hello!")
}
```

In a language like C# or Java, we have to be explicit when a class implements an interface:

```go
public class ConsoleLogger : Logger {
  public void Logger(message string) {
    Console.WriteLine(message)
  }
}
```

In Go, this happens implicitly. If your structure has a function name `Log` with a `string` parameter and no return value, then it can be used as a `Logger`. This cuts down on the verboseness of using interfaces:

```go
type ConsoleLogger struct {}
func (l ConsoleLogger) Log(message string) {
  fmt.Println(message)
}
```

It also tends to promote small and focused interfaces. The standard library is full of interfaces. The `io` package has a handful of popular ones such as `io.Reader`, `io.Writer`, and `io.Closer`. If you write a function that expects a parameter that you'll only be calling `Close()` on, you absolutely should accept an `io.Closer` rather than whatever concrete type you're using.

Interfaces can also participate in composition. And, interfaces themselves can be composed of other interfaces. For example, `io.ReadCloser` is an interface composed of the `io.Reader` interface as well as the `io.Closer` interface.

Finally, interfaces are commonly used to avoid cyclical imports. Since they don't have implementations, they'll have limited dependencies.

## Before You Continue

Ultimately, how you structure your code around Go's workspace is something that you'll only feel comfortable with after you've written a couple of non-trivial projects. What's most important for you to remember is the tight relationship between package names and your directory structure (not just within a project, but within the entire workspace).

The way Go handles visibility of types is straightforward and effective. It's also consistent. There are a few things we haven't looked at, such as constants and global variables but rest assured, their visibility is determined by the same naming rule.

Finally, if you're new to interfaces, it might take some time before you get a feel for them. However, the first time you see a function that expects something like `io.Reader`, you'll find yourself thanking the author for not demanding more than he or she needed.
